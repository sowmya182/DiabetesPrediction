# Diabetes Prediction Using Health Indicators

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes in women based on health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin, age, and pregnancies. The objective is to develop a predictive model that identifies the likelihood of developing diabetes, which could support early diagnosis and targeted intervention in healthcare settings. The study explores various statistical techniques and machine learning methods to evaluate key risk factors and generate reliable predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It contains 768 rows and 9 columns, representing female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged at least 21 years. Key predictor variables include:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

The response variable is "Outcome," where 1 indicates diabetes and 0 indicates no diabetes.

## Methods
1. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and removed outliers for better model performance.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized the distribution of variables and checked for correlations between predictors and diabetes.
3. **Modeling**: A random forest model was developed to predict diabetes. The model achieved 77% accuracy and demonstrated strong sensitivity, though specificity was lower.
4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance was assessed using a confusion matrix and an ROC curve, with an AUC score of 0.79, indicating good prediction ability.

## Results
- Glucose level was the most significant predictor of diabetes, followed by BMI, age, and the number of pregnancies.
- The random forest model provided reliable predictions with opportunities for further optimization, especially to address class imbalance.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated that health indicators such as glucose, BMI, and age are valuable predictors of diabetes. Future improvements could focus on enhancing model performance and addressing class imbalance to improve specificity.
